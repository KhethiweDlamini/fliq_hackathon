# Quantum Coalition Future Leaders in Quantum (QC-FLIQ) Virtual Hackathon | Implementing Quantum Experiments
ðŸŽ² Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) â€” A Beginnerâ€™s Quantum Adventure

Welcome to the quantum side of randomness! In this interactive notebook, youâ€™ll learn how to use real quantum computers to flip coins, generate random numbers, and even build your quantum dice. No prior experience required!

ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn
What randomness is (and why classical computers canâ€™t do it well)
* How quantum physics brings true unpredictability
* How to write and run quantum code using Qiskit
* How to use IBMâ€™s real quantum computers
