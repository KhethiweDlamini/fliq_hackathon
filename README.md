# Quantum Coalition Future Leaders in Quantum (QC-FLIQ) Virtual Hackathon | Implementing Quantum Experiments
🎲 Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) — A Beginner’s Quantum Adventure

Welcome to the quantum side of randomness! In this interactive notebook, you’ll learn how to use real quantum computers to flip coins, generate random numbers, and even build your quantum dice. No prior experience required!

📚 What You’ll Learn
What randomness is (and why classical computers can’t do it well)
* How quantum physics brings true unpredictability
* How to write and run quantum code using Qiskit
* How to use IBM’s real quantum computers

🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone or Download This Project
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/qrng-tutorial.git
cd qrng-tutorial
2. Set Up Your Environment
Option A: Using Qiskit on Your Computer (Windows/Mac/Linux)
Install Qiskit and required tools:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install qiskit matplotlib qiskit-ibm-provider
Then, open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook qrng_tutorial.ipynb
Option B: Use It Online (No Setup Needed!)
Head to qBraid Lab, create a free account, and upload the notebook file.

3. Run the Notebook Step-by-Step
You’ll build your own quantum circuit, simulate it, and finally submit it to IBM Quantum’s real hardware 🌍.
